# Motivation

Much of a researchers live in modern economic research is spent in front of a computer -- be it to analyze data or to simulate economic models.

Unfortunately, it is rare that we have been taught how to do this in a structured and efficient way.
Class exposure to programming languages is most often limited to the simple use of Stata and Matlab to solve `toy' examples designed to illustrate a theoretical result or implement a method with known properties and ex-ante known results.
These skills, like copy and pasting pieces of code repeatedly, do not scale up in a straightforward manner to handle complex projects that make up research papers, PhD theses or typical work in government or private business settings.
As a result, young economic researchers spend too much time wrestling with software and too little time doing economics -- our comparative advantage.
Even with large investments in software wrestling and self-learned skills, we typically have no idea how reliable or efficient our programs are.

This course is designed to improve learners' programming abilities.
It is aimed at PhD students who expect to write their theses in a field that requires modest to heavy use of computation.
Examples include applied microeconomics, econometrics, macroeconomics, computational economics and any field that either involves real-world data or does not generally lead to models with simple closed-form solutions.

The course introduces students to a set of industry standard tools and programming methods that aim to reduce time spent programming while at the same time making programs more dependable and results reproducible.
It draws extensively on basic techniques and tools that are the backbone of modern software development and have enabled the development and maintainance of Windows or the Google search engine.
At the same time, these tools are simple enough to be used in small research projects, too.
The course shows the usefulness of these techniques and trains the student in them by means of hands-on examples for a wide variety of economic and econometric applications.

# Target Audience

This course is intended for PhD students who are transitioning from coursework to research.
Next to your economics background, we will only assume that you have written small pieces of code before, like Stata .do-files or Matlab .m-files for problem sets in your Masters degree or first-year PhD classes.
Knowledge of a specific programming language is not required.

A large part of this course is really about tool choice.
We will take care in pointing out which language is most appropriate for which problem, and provide you with introductions to two popular choices for data- and computationally intensive computing.
We also introduce a tool kit designed to improve the replicability of your code.
The programming languages and tools introduced in the course are not the only choices available but some knowledge of these languages and best practices will make picking up others on your own relatively easy by providing a solid basic training.

#  Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Use a computer's command line to provide text instructions that can navigate around a computer's filesystem, copy and move files and edit new/existing files.
2. Explain different variable types and their advantages and disadvantages in Python and R.
3. Construct scripts that load, manipulate and visualize data in Python and R.
4. Implement statistical and economic models in Python and R.
5. Run Python and R inside a GUI and from the command line (including passing across complex arguments).
6. Explain the advantages of using a Version Control Software such as Git as opposed to 'manual' version control.
7. Manage a version controlled project using Git.
8. Explain what a workflow management system is and their advantages for economics and business research.
9. Manage a research project using the workflow management software Snakemake.


Learning objectives for specific modules will be provided within the Course Notes.

# Evaluation

The course is evaluated on a pass/fail basis. 
There will be a final assignment that is due four weeks after the course concludes that utilizes the tools student's learned to use in class. 
This assignment will count 100\%. 
More information will be provided in the first class.

# Rules of the Game

The class is designed to be `hands-on' in the sense that you will be programming a lot of things *during the class*.
We strongly believe the only way to learn programming is to do programming.
Please bring your laptop with you to each session and install the required software before the course begins.
Try to complete each activity we do in class and be prepared to ask and answer questions during class.
Slides or notes will be made available at the beginning of each day, codes that solve exercises will be posted during or after the session.

# Office Hours

Due to the intensive nature of the course, we have decided to not schedule office hours.
Feel free to talk to us before and after each session throughout the course and ask many questions during each session.


# Times and Locations

* Dates: Daily from 1st September until 17th September (excluding weekends)
* Morning Session: 9.30 - 12.30
* Afternoon Session: 14.00 - 17.00
* Location: TBA

## Brief Topic Outlines

### Terminal

The Unix shell emphasizes providing text-based instructions to computers.
It's a power lies in the ability to do complex and repetitive tasks with a few keystrokes.
Use of the shell is fundamental starting point into using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including "high-performance computing" and cloud computing resources).

### Python Programming Language

Python is one of the most popular and fastest growing programming language because of its ease of use and power.
It has also become the most used statistical software in the recent years.
These modules have two distinct goals: (1) introduce basic programming syntax, and (2) introducing specific packages that are useful for computational analysis and data-driven research.
We introduce basic programming syntax using the Python language because of its simplicity to get started for novice users.
The introductions to specific packages are designed to highlight how to solve problems that are typically encountered by economics and business researchers -- such as solving models using computational techniques, the automated collection of data from websites and applied econometric modeling.
We emphasize best practice techniques as we progress through the material.

### Version Control

Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what software development teams, and increasingly applied researchers, use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate.
The idea of a formal version control software is to take systematic 'snapshots' of our work and store the changes so one can easily track the development of their work and, when necessary go to a previous version of a file. 
We introduce the basics of version control using Git, and show how to use it with online repositories such as GitHub to share our work with others.
We then look at more advanced version control techniques such as maintaining multiple parallel versions of our files so that we can test out changes, and then either revert back to an old state or integrate the new updates into our stable code base.

Every large software development project relies on it, and programmers use it for their small jobs as well.
And it isnâ€™t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.
Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded or a former version of a file has been overwritten).

### The R Programming Language

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis.
R is free and has a wide array of third-party packages for almost all imaginable statistical applications. 
The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R and to teach best practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.
This workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, data wrangling, data visualization and regression techniques common to applied researchers.

### Build Tools

Build Tools can run commands to read files, process these files in some way, and write out the processed files in a specified order. 
For example, we can:

* Run analysis scripts on raw data files to get data files that summarize the raw data;
* Run visualization scripts on data files to produce plots and statistical tables; and to
* Parse and combine text files, tables and plots to create papers.

Most importantly, Build Tools track the dependencies between the files they create and the files used to create them. 
This allows build tools to only recompute necessary steps after a data or code file has been changed -- without the need to run the whole project from the beginning.
